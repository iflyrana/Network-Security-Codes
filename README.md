# Network Security Codes

This repository contains experimental code implementations for network security concepts. The experiments are implemented in both Python and C++.

## Contents

- [Python](./python): Contains Python implementations of network security experiments.
- [C++](./cpp): Contains C++ translations of the Python implementations, assisted by ChatGPT.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for understanding network security concepts through practical implementations. The code is organized into two folders: Python and C++. The Python folder contains original implementations written by me, while the C++ folder contains translations of the Python code, aided by ChatGPT.

## Experiment Codes

The experiment codes focus on various network security topics, including encryption, decryption, and cryptographic algorithms. It is recommended to understand the concepts rather than memorize the code.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you can implement these codes with simple logic you are welcomed
